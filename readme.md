### A place to find out which Camera you should buy!



First of all I will provide you the link to the Whichcam Website:
https://dev.itas.ca/~milad.fotoohnejad/ITAS_191/FinalProject/index.html

## Features

- This website contains a homepage and five information page
- It provides a proper comparison for three types of camera
- Pictures of different cameras is provided for better selection
- There are links that lead to the actual shops as well as maps for in-store shoppings




# W3C Validator

I copied all of my Body tags which contains all of the HTML syntaxses into the W3C Validator, there were only few errors for spaces between my codes, so I fixed it. There was an error that wasn't meaningful to me! I will put the error here and explain more:

 Error: Parse Error. Style sheets should not include HTML syntax. From line 1, column 1; to line 1, column 67 <body class="container-fluid h-100 text-center text-white bg-dark">↩    <

Here it says Style Sheets should not contain any HTML syntax, which there is only a Body tag that carries a Bootstrap class. 

# CSS 

In this website, different types of templates were used. I will go through most of them: 
- In the first part, there is a navigation bar (all other five pages have the same nav-bar) that I customized completely using bootstrap classes and embedded style css classes. It has different parts such as logo images (changing the size of them to show the best of it), and four other parts: Home, Information, Contact us, Products. There are various changes in this part but the main navigation bar is a Bootstrap template which I added a drop-down to it to show the products. The completed navigation bar now is mostly different from what it was before..  
- On the main page there is a Carousel with three pictures which I imported the pictures to and changed the classes to be compatible with my dark style. There are Buttons, Images, HTML tags, Contents, Captions, Bootstrap and CSS classes added to it.
- There are three columns that I customized in a way of matching with the colours of the camera brands. Now the wohle page has a colour harmony which you can see the three colors (White, Yellow, Red) in every part of the page. It took a long time to macth everything together, one of them is using the gradient for the captions of some sections. 
- There are three other sections showing the pictures some information about the cameras, there can be seen lots of customization such as using different kinds of classes in bootstrap and CSS. For example, using anchor tags to work as a button with a link to each product page.
- In the footer, I used a template in Bootstrap and changed the classes to match everything and a table to show some information as well.
- In other pages I used a similar way of design, since every picture is responsive in the website the contents are matched with all of them, I used modals to show some messages, and features for the cameras.
- I used JavaScript to Show a map with a picture on it as a marker for the Information page, changing the Background color of the page, and checking the validation of the postal code in the form I have in Contact us page.

# Future Contents

If I had more time I would work on the sections of each page, I think the contents are not enough to compare cameras together. I would add more pictures to each section and use more creative classes of the Bootstrap.

# Other Features

Bootstrap is a world of different classes and styles, but definitley I would like to add a proper side-bar to my website but I didn't have the time to do so! 

# Feedback

This course was one of my favourite classes this semester, wish I could join you earlier and have more time to do my assignments better. I like what I was doing during this class and this Final project. I learnt Lots of things in this period, mostly from you and some of them on my own. The amount of content you covered in this course was incredibly adequate. I didn't think I could build a website after this semester, and this is AWESOME for me! thank you for everything, you were so supportive to me during this time, There is NO complaint.
